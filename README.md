# Social Network

This is a basic social network which allows the user to register, log in, add friends and start chatting with them.
The front end is built with Angular 17 and the back end with Java 17 and Spring Boot. The data is stored in a MySQL server, and the passwords are encrypted
When a user receives a friend request he has to accept it to start chatting with the user sending the request. The program suggests new friends in order of descending friends in common number.
